# Motivation

Basically I got tired doing up to 5 steps each time I wanted to switch between refresh rates for saving battery life or for playing Pokemon GO (it's harder to get a curve ball ðŸ˜…). I needed something quicker, so I created this APP.

# But... How can you switch it?

Simple! Each time you switch it over settings menu you change the `oneplus_screen_refresh_rate` global value setting it to `1` when `60 Hz`, `2` when it's `Auto` and `0` when it's `90 Hz`.

# Installation

- Download the [app](https://github.com/ti0ma/oneplus-screen-shortcut/releases/download/v1.0/OnePlusRefreshRateSwitch.apk) ðŸš€
- Install it in your awesome OnePlus 7 series ðŸ¤©
- Enable developer tools (Settings -> about phone -> click on "Build number" several times) ðŸ› 
- Enable USB debugging (Settings -> System -> Developer options -> USB Debugging) ðŸ”¬
- Set up ADB ([More info](https://www.xda-developers.com/quickly-install-adb/)) ðŸ› 
- Run `adb shell pm grant me.molonosov.oprefreshrate android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` (Without this permission the application would not be able to change the parameter) ðŸ’»

Now, you can edit the quick settings layout and add the `Tile` whereever you want ;)
